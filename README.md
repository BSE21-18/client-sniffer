# client-sniffer

The Client-Sniffer component comprises of six MOS gas sensors and DHT22 sensor for temperature and relative humidity. 
This component collects VOCs samples from the tomato leaf head space in form of analog signals interfaced with ADC on 
a ESP32 microcontroller development board. Each of the gas sensors has a different sensitivity towards different gasses 
including the biomarkers of late bright. When the gasses react with the gas sensors voltage values are manipulated 
accordingly.
